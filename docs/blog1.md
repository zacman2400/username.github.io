## About

I think what I struggled with during clinical rotations third year was how to organize the firehose of clinical information aimed at me. It was very easy (honestly easier than during basic science years) to fall into a routine of wake up early, go to clinic, see patients, study for the shelf in the evenings, and repeat. I got the details of the clinical information down well enough, but what I felt was missing was a consistent way to organize my clinical knowledge into a framework that would allow application to novel settings. The point of knowledge (to me at least) is to be able to use it 

Is their definitive management available for this diagnosis i.e. surgerize/invasive management in the case of a STEMI?

-Diagnositics are not binary, disease often exists on a spectrum
Far advanced end of the spectrum, management is often clear: surgerize/invasive management
Relatively benign end of the spectrum (and by benign I mean acutely benign): watch and wait or medical management outpatient
Its the intermediate category that often times is difficult

A great instance of these ideas is coronary syndrome management

-diagnosis is important, but unlike board questions it is not a single look process: what investigations are needed to help suggest a diagnosis or further management?
