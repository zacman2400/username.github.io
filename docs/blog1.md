## About

I think what I struggled with during clinical rotations third year was how to organize the firehose of clinical information aimed at me. It was very easy (honestly easier than during
the basic science years) to fall into a routine of wake up early, go to clinic, see patients, study for the shelf in the evenings, and repeat. I got the details of the clinical information
down well enough, but what I felt was missing was a consistent way to organize my clinical knowledge and more importantly apply it to novel situations.
